# ML-Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level machine learning projects. Each project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates various machine learning techniques and data analysis processes.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Heart Disease Data Preparation
- **Notebook**: `Heart-Disease-Data-Prep.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook focuses on preparing a heart disease dataset for analysis. It includes data loading, exploration, and basic preprocessing steps.

### 2. Temperature Linear Regression
- **Notebook**: `Temperature-Linear-Regression.ipynb`
- **Description**: This project involves performing linear regression on a temperature dataset. It covers data visualization, model training, and evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².

### 3. Car Price Multiple Regression
- **Notebook**: `Car-Price-Multi-Regression.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook performs multiple regression analysis on a car price dataset, including data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

### 4. Admission Decision Tree Classification
- **Notebook**: `Admission-Decision-Tree.ipynb`
- **Description**: This project builds a decision tree classifier to predict admission chances based on various features. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

### 5. Customer K-Means Clustering
- **Notebook**: `Customer-KMeans-Clustering.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook applies K-means clustering to a customer dataset, evaluates the model using silhouette scores, and visualizes the clustering results.

### 6. Market Basket Association Rules
- **Notebooks**: `Market-Basket-Association-Rules-Part1.ipynb`, `Market-Basket-Association-Rules-Part2.ipynb`
- **Description**: These notebooks perform association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm on a market basket dataset. They include data preprocessing, rule generation, and analysis.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikpatil7/ML-Portfolio.git
   cd ML-Portfolio
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start Jupyter Notebook to view and run the notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Open a notebook**:
   In the Jupyter interface, navigate to the desired notebook and open it to explore the code and results.

## Datasets

The datasets used in these projects are available in the `datasets` folder within this repository. They are also available for download from Kaggle. You will need a Kaggle account to access the datasets on Kaggle. Follow these steps if you prefer to download from Kaggle:

1. **Create a Kaggle account**: If you don't have one, sign up at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
2. **Download the datasets**: Navigate to the specific dataset pages on Kaggle and download the datasets to your local machine.
3. **Place the datasets**: Ensure the datasets are placed in the appropriate directories as expected by the notebooks.
